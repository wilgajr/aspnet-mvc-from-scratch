# aspnet-mvc-from-scratch
An Asp.Net Core MVC 3.1 recipes project, built from a blank template, intended to be used as a way for me to catch up with the latest innovations added in framework version 3; and as a future reference for this very developer :)

This project to work properly, requires node.js and Visual Studio Bundler & Minifier extension.
